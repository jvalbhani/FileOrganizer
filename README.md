# FileOrganizer
The project is prepared for dealing day to day problem of Cleaning up a cluttered directory on laptop or PC disks, especially the Downloads Folder or the Desktop could be a nightmare. Everyone has to do that tedious task to clean up the drives once in a while. The biggest    problem is identifying what files need to be deleted and organized on a Desktop.

The app is created in Swing (JAVA).
i have tried using level order traversal algorithm for getting 10 big files according to size
and for managing folder user can select a directory and then can organize all the files inside the directory except the shortcut's link
